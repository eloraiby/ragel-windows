/**
 * \class AvlMap
 * \brief Key and value oriented AVL tree. 
 *
 * AvlMap stores key and value pairs in elements that managed by the tree. It
 * is intendend to be similar to map template found in the STL. AvlMap
 * requires that a Key type, a Value type, and a class containing a compare()
 * routine for Key be given. Items can be inserted with just a key or with a
 * key and value pair.
 *
 * AvlMap assumes all elements in the tree are allocated on the heap and are
 * to be managed by the tree. This means that the class destructor will delete
 * the contents of the tree. A deep copy will cause existing elements to be
 * deleted first.
